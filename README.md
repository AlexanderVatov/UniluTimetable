# UniluTimetable

There is no login activity yet. For testing purposes, credentials are hard-coded in a class called Credentials.
In order to build the project, add to GuichetEtudiant/src/main/java/lu/uni/avatov/guichetetudiant a file called Credentials.java with the following code:

```java
package lu.uni.avatov.guichetetudiant;

public class Credentials {
    public static final String username = "<username>";
    public static final String password = "<password>";
}
```
